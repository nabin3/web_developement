* The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

* css cascade rules: last is used, specificity, important.
* background-color or border properties; they are not inherited by child elements.

* You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from their parent elements by using inherit for the value of the properties.
