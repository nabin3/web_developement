There are three type of lists:
1. Ordered list.
2. Unordered lists.
3. Definition list.

* Ordered list is created with <ol> and each item in list will be written in <li>.
* Unordered list is created with <ul> and each item in list will be written in <li>.
* Definition list is created with <dl> and each definition term is written inside <dt> and each definition is written inside <dd>

* You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sub-list or nested list.
